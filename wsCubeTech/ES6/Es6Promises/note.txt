A promise in JS is similar to a promise in real life. 
when we make a promise in real life, it is a guarantee that we are going to do someting in future.
Because promises can only be made for the future
A promise is an object. There are 3 states of the promise object
1. Pending: Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails
2. Resolved; Completed Promise
3. Rejected: Failed Promise
